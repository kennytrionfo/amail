Building an angular gmail (amail) app: 

Create a generic index.html page

Create a stylesheet for html page. 

Put the scripts you'll be using at the bottom of the body: 
	jquery
	angular
	bootstrap? 
	etc

Put the link to the stylesheet in the header. 

Put the application scope in place so that the app can us angular by putting the ng-app directive in the html element.
	Like: 
	<html ng-app="myApp">
	in the top html app


Put a div in with another scope / directive for a controller of TestCtrl
	<div ng-controller="TestCtrl">
	</div>

Put in an input field and assign the input to a model called title: 
	like: 
	<input type="text" ng-model="title">
	so in end will look like: 
	<div ng-controller="TestCtrl">
		<h1>{{title}}</h1>
   	<input type="text" ng-model="title">
	</div>
